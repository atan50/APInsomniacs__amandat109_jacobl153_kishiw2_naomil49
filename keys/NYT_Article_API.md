Collected Knowledge & Wisdom on
# New York Times APIs

## Provides:
This API provides devos who wish to read and educate themselves access to New York Times APIs, with many broad databases of information, for example:

- **NYT Article Search**: An API to search and find specific articles based on keywords.
- **Most Popular**: An API to find the most popular articles based on given metrics.
- **Top Stories**: An API to the top stories of the NYT in a given section(cooking, sports, home page, etc).
- **AND SO MUCH MORE**

### Pain factor: 1
(0=ezpz...5=nightmare)

The NYT developer website is fairly straightforward, and even has a "get started" link for a tab with instructions on how to set up different API keys, and good organization. The documentation for each API is clean as well, with details on how to adjust the url for select results.

### Key Provisioning:     

- Definitely make sure to click the get started link in the top-right of the home page, because it will give a generally comprehensive set of instructions that will help will most of the steps here.
- Sign-up for an account with your Name, email, password.
- Confirm the account from an email sent to you.
- Explore the APIs page for all the ones you may want to use.
- Click on your user profile in the top-right, and go to Apps. In Apps, you can create a new app, with an adequate description and title for storage.
  - I suggest to make one where you enable it with access for all APIs, just so you don't have too many to manage.

### Quotas:
- The only thing you must do is set up an account, with an email (that you must verify), First and Last name, and a password.

## The Good:
- The site is very clean and easy to navigate. Should be user-friendly for anyone.
- The get started guide is very direct and will help a lot when making the account and keys.
- The documentation is neat and detailed for every API, and makes it clear what you need to do.
- There are up to 500 requests per day, and up to 5 requests per minute, and no paid plans.
## The Bad:
- I assume it is most probable that the APIs do not update very quickly in times there are rapid changes to certain information.
- There are up to 500 requests per day, and up to 5 requests per minute. A possible downside for some uses.
## The Ugly:
- The APIs often need specifications in the url, rather than just adding you key to the base url. You often have to adjust with additional parameters such as section titles, author names, or dates. Although this may be hard to handle, if you pay attention to the documentation it should be straightforward.
